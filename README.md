The Gaming Room was a client who requested to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It, to a variety of platforms via a web-based application. Creating requirements and a cohesive picture from their wishes was simple, but analysing the frontend and backend requirements was challenging. I found the Software Design Document easy to use, and felt that organizing my thoughts in that way helped me to create the best possible output. I do wish I could have spent more time with the fine details in my Reccomendations section. While working on the project, I did my best to pull every detail I could out of any provided documentation from The Gaming Room, and translated the words into a definition of "done" for the project. It is important to do so to ensure the final product matches the client's vision as closely as possible. Throughout this course, I learned a lot about what tangible things actually comprise software, and I look forward to using this knowledge base in future projects.
